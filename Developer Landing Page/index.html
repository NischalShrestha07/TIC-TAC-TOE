                <p>
                    Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating,
                    building, and
                    maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also
                    include web design, web
                    programming, and database management.

                    Apps are faster to build but need an abstraction layer that can result in lower performance. Web to
                    Native: Web Native
                    is a form of cross-platform mobile application development using web technologies to create native
                    mobile applications
                    for iOS and Android, as well as mobile-optimized Progressive Web Apps (PWA).

                <p>
                    Usability is a critical aspect of UI/UX design. The interface should be easy to navigate and
                    understand, with clear and
                    concise labels, instructions, and feedback. Designers should focus on minimizing the number of steps
                    required to
                    complete a task, reducing the cognitive load on the user.
